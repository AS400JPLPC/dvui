zig 0.12:
- if sliceAsBytes/bytesAsSlice includes sentinel, then need to update our use

check zig std lib for bytesAsSlice alignment - should it always aligncast?

add to readme-implementation

add to readme a section about layout from a high level
- either want a widget to take their min size, or expand to fill
- if not expanded, gravity moves the widget around
- if a parent widget is not expanded, all child widgets will get their min size

change the layout section of the demo to be interactive with checkboxes for expanding

on hidpi display, selecting a bunch of text leaves small gaps noticeable in the selection background


add touch stuff for editing/copy/paste/select all/etc. on textLayout and textEntry
- draggables should still show during scrolling
- need to be able to drag-scroll draggables
- floating context doesn't show when we are dragging draggables
- floating context needs smarter positioning
- on the very first time textLayout gets a touch click (no drag), we DO want to set the cursor
- if the draggable's point is not visible then don't show the draggable


rename popup to floatingmenu (and deprecate old name for a while)

remove entypo icons for companies


see if we can get the mach backend working again
- maybe just use the glfw part of mach?
- can we also get it working in a browser?

don't use box for slider, use WidgetData directly?  Other widgets?

should box do something intelligent about dividing space if snap_to_pixels is on?

UI scaling on Windows causes fonts to look blurry, maybe if snap to pixels is true, we round to nearest font size and then don't adjust for target_fraction?

add hyperlink functionality to textLayout

add more keyboard shortcuts to textEntry
- select all
- home
- end
- pgup/pgdown

touch scrolling velocity should be based on how far the finger has moved in the last bit of time (not how much it moved in the last event)

need a button for sizing/rotation for icon and raster that works continuously while you hold it down
- add option to Button where when in the down position it keeps refreshing

add FlexLayoutWidget
- doesn't have independent min height/width (works like textLayout)
- start with no expand, and only left->right top->bottom

if using standalone, should be able to draw using SDL stuff into a widget
- so base window needs to not delay rendering so you can render ontop of widget backgrounds

when new events come in, we assign the focus id, but probably shouldn't once we see a focus mouse event


need a strategy for activating paste from a menu, because the widget will lose focus when the menu is activated
- when the menu gets focus, maybe it saves the previous focus id?
- then when the paste menu item is clicked, it can send focus back to saved id
  - also need to synthesize an event so that widget processes a paste

add inertia to scrolling
- if the scrollContainer has more intertia scrolling to do, then it should eat all pointer events, because we don't want any pointer events going to children if the scrolling is still happening

switch from my freetype fork to Mach's

scaling:
- when we are at 125% on linux x11 gnome, then the fonts look bad?
- test on Windows
- test on Mac

change BoxWidget to take InitOptions

change MenuWidget to take InitOptions
- also should take parentSubwindowId

popupSet - can this be done as a static var inside PopupWidget?

remove the color_style error?
- success and error styles are only used on buttons, so maybe special case them


send updates to tinyvg

maybe builtin button should record multiple clicks?
- helps in low framerate situations

demo:
- add uses of animate

icon browser: when clicking an icon, copy the buttonIcon line of code and show a toast
- can the demo have more of these kind of "click to copy the code" things?

look into why mouse events seem delayed when using vsync
- try only calling SDL_PollEvent (or pump events) once per frame? (and using peep events to actually get the events)

unify Widget and WidgetData somehow?

TextLayout support for large documents
- need a function to say "we are skipping a bunch of bytes" (might be useful for code folding as well)
- addTextDone needs to not always set cursor because there might be lots of text remaining that we aren't rendering

get mach example working again
- MachBackend should save the passed allocator


add alpha to Options as well and multiply it by the theme alpha

example toast that includes "undo"

add disabled to options so the seek forward/backward icons can be grayed out?
- need to add ability to gray out things too (alpha to options?)
- is disabled just a visual thing?
  - can still tab/click on it?
- when disabled, can't tab to that thing?
  - if focused and disabled, call tabIndexNext


can't format {d:02} needs {d:0>2}?

add backend function to allow screensaver

audit backends for how to use them on top of an existing app

separate background and border drawing:
- embed a convex polygon triangulator?  Will need for arbitrary pathing in any case
- can draw border by walking along both arcs in parallel trying to keep the angle of the line between the points alternating around 45 deg

cross-widget dragging (for stuff like docking)
- dragPreStart and dragStart take a ?[]const u8 ("_dock")
- dragging also takes a ?[]const u8
  - will return the point if either widget has mouse capture or string matches
- widgets that only do mouse capture dragging can pass null
- other widgets have to coordinate via the string
  - need to be able to call dragging outside of processing events so you can change appearance if the drag you are interested in is happening

for normal animations should be able to do a wrapper widget
- can animate from 0 to min_size (gotten from deinit)
- can deanimate from current size to 0
- floating windows are different since they aren't in the normal flow
 - need a special wrapper for them which doesn't insert itself into the heirarchy just adjusts values

look into logging, how to use it in general and how to use it for gui stuff?
- const scope_name = std.log.scoped(.whatever);
- Then define a log function with the appropriate signature in your root file?
- maybe can use WidgetData.init to help with logging or debug mode?

how can I get mach to not build all it's stuff when I'm compiling an sdl example?
- need for it to do the work in a build step rather than when the build step is being made

-Dtarget=wasm32-freestanding-none

mach-test: no tab key?

linux mach-test: moving GUI Demo window around lags

more docs
- tabindex
- seamless animations

start making real demo() contents
- document stuff inside there?
- following dear imgui demo
 - Basic Widgets
  - radio
  - hold-repeat buttons
  - tooltips
  - dropdown selection
- mouse cursors
- gravity
- themes

Tooltips:
- wrapper around thing you want the tooltip for
- floating windows similar to popup
- popup has 3-4 states:
  - ready (on first frame where the mouse pointer is above the rect, go to 
  showing)
  - timer (could go here and wait for timer)
  - showing (tooltip popup shows, go to off if the mouse pointer is not 
  above rect)
  - off (go to ready on a frame where the mouse pointer is off our rect)
  var ttw = ToolTipWidget.init...
- if (ttw.active()) |p| {
    // p is the point of the mouse when the tooltip was activated
    var ttp = TooltipPopupWidget.init... (pass in TooltipWidget's screenrect, optionally previous ttp if nested)
    // ttp
    ttp.install();
    // tooltip contents
    ttp.deinit();
    // ttp.deinit() checks:
      - if we have a live nested ttp, we stay alive
      - if the current mouse pointer is not above ttp OR the passed in ttw screenrect, we stay alive
      - if staying alive and we have a ttp parent, tell that parent we are live
  }


test what happens if std.time.nanoTimestamp() jumps backwards or forwards
- if backwards just a tiny bit, stay on frame_time_ns?
- if backwards more (or forwards a lot), reset frame_time_ns and also shift any animations?
- check begin() and beginWait()


text input support in mach
clipboard support in mach

xstart and ystart for textSize

kerning
- check how sdl_ttf does it

popup needs to align it's text with the label that popped it
- take a flag for whether it's popping updown or sideways, then adjust x or y to account for border and padding

switch to adwaita default font?

mach: do clipping in the shader?

premultiplied alpha for all textures (and vertices from PathStroke/Fill?)
- also font glyphs
- what is SDL_rendergeometry doing?

when we have a widget that has captured the mouse, need to capture the mouse in the underlying window system so click-dragging works even when the mouse pointer goes outside the window

some visual indication of non-focused windows
- maybe change focus color inside?

hover and highlight properties need to propogate down to children so that icons can draw properly in buttons where the button is highlighted but not the icon directly?
  - maybe as part of the Options struct?


dialog
- maybe a flag on floatingwindow?
- have a separate function that does the nextWindowCleanup
  - always call in deinit, but also user can call that and get result if the user pressed esc
  - are there other things a user could press?
- rss textentry should bubble up the enter that it doesn't process so the dialog can record that it should "submit"
 - maybe always bubble up dialog-related key presses?

maybe use stb_truetype or whatever so we don't need sdl_ttf?
- translate-c is failing for a few of the functions
- could make separate repo just like stb_image

change cursorlayout from top-to-bottom to left-to-right with optional extra floating widgets that get routed around
- save info for each line
  - size and baseline offset
  - height is max of (height of items without baseline) and max of (max of baselines, max of underhangs) of items with baselines
  - if new size/baseline is different, cueFrame()
- replace menubar horizontal box with textlayout so that lots of menus will wrap

baseline alignment
- maybe only inside TextLayout?
- vertical alignment needs additional .baseline
- rectFor provides baseline float offset from top of rect
- minSize needs to send baseline offset
- PlaceIn honors .baseline alignment

make Alt do special stuff with the menubar

scroll widget when stuff is being added/deleted
- lock to top if there previously
- scroll to bottom if there previously
- otherwise scroll to widget that was in the middle?
